# drawpix
This is a drawing app originally built for the blackberry tablet in landscape mode.  This app was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery.  No pre-processors, configuration or builds are needed. To run it, just launch the index file in any browser.  Please note that some blackberry-specific functionality such as save file won't work on other devices.

This app is intended for demo purposes only and can be run on most browsers including touch-based devices such as the iPhone and iPad.  This is made public as an example of an application that I developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript/JQuery primarily using the HTML5 Canvas API.

This app was built by Jacquie Callahan at PixelJo.com.
